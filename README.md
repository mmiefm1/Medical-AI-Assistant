# 🏥 Medical AI Assistant — RAG-powered Document Chatbot

---

## 🧠 Overview

**Medical AI Assistant** is an intelligent chatbot that lets users upload medical documents and ask health-related questions. Built on **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, the system retrieves the most relevant content from uploaded PDFs before generating accurate, context-aware responses — reducing hallucinations common in general-purpose LLMs.

## 🎓 Why RAG?

Standard LLMs generate answers from training data alone, which can be outdated or inaccurate for specialized domains like medicine. RAG solves this by grounding every response in **your actual documents** — making answers both reliable and traceable.

## 🔄 How It Works

```
User uploads PDF
      ↓
Text extracted → split into chunks → embedded → stored in Pinecone
      ↓
User asks a question
      ↓
Question embedded → similar chunks retrieved from Pinecone
      ↓
Retrieved context + question → LLaMA 3.1 via Groq
      ↓
Accurate, document-grounded answer
```
